An open-source AI-powered memory tracking system with motion awareness and object detection

--------------------------------------------------------------->Iâ€™m developing an open-source AI project called MemoSphere, which uses AI and robotics to help people track objects, schedule reminders, and enhance daily memory functions. I plan to use the pack to access tools like GitHub Codespaces for development, free domains for project hosting, and cloud hosting for prototypes.
